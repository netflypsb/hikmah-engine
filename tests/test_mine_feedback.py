"""`tools/mine_feedback.py` recurrence-rate self-improvement signal regression tests (Brain benchmark T2).

Verifies that `--checkpoint` computes the recurrence rate of already-treated
patterns against the previous cycle's CORRECTION fingerprint — a measured
self-improvement signal (lower recurrence = feedback settled). The review window
is lower-bounded only (after the watermark), so cycles are simulated in
chronological order.

The fixtures use Korean operator utterances, and the Korean correction/prohibition
patterns are gated on korean_mode(), so these tests run under WIKI_LANG=ko via an
autouse fixture.
