"""Aggregate the `tools/_defect-log.jsonl` corpus to surface recurring defects — the automatic defect channel.

Sibling of `mine_feedback.py` (the operator-utterance channel). The difference is the
input source — not human utterances, but verifier-grounded defects caught by lint/Desk
and ingested via `log_defect.py`. Being a prefilter, it prescribes nothing — it only
aggregates and prioritizes; which surface to fix is judged by the Editor-in-Chief who
reads it (the input to the SoT self-evolution workflow's § Propose, Input analysis).

Grouping key = `cluster` (the slugified mechanism-cluster join key shared with
transitions; legacy records without it fall back to `mechanism`). The same cluster is
broken out by caught_at stage — which rung it escaped from signals which surface is empty.

Priority = **recurrence after *preventive* treatment > support count**. A cluster that had
prevention put in place (`treatment` of `prevent`·`both`) and reappeared anyway is top
priority — that is a treatment failure. Counting every accept as a treatment is wrong:
a cluster accepted by adding a **checker** (`detect`) accumulates records because the
checker works, and one accepted by cleaning up instances (`remediate`) never had a
prevention. Both are held out of the recurrence tier and marked `▷unprev`.
Vocabulary SoT: `log_defect.py` TREATMENTS; the judgment is made by a human at ingest.

**A cluster carrying a closed verdict (`reject`·`defer`) drops to a lower tier.** `accept`
does not close one — a treatment's effect is still under observation and a recurrence
after it is this tool's top signal. The verdict is kept in the ledger (`latest_decisions`
below does not cut by window) but never reached the screen, so an axis already rejected or
deferred stood up as "top priority" every cycle: 6 of this corpus's clusters hold one. The
tier reads "judged", not "settled", because a bundle disposition can cover several clusters
at once — the marker states which proposal was judged, not that the cluster is finished.

Only the **latest** verdict counts. Picking any reject from the whole history hides a later
one — this corpus has a cluster accepted in August and rejected a week later, and another
deferred and then accepted, which an any-verdict read would get backwards in both
directions.

Support count measures **review effort, not defect rate** — a deeply reviewed batch takes
the ranking (this corpus runs 8 to 42 defects a week). Read a large support as "looked at
hard here" before reading it as "fails most here". The review window is managed by a
watermark (same design as `mine_feedback`) — `--checkpoint` advances the boundary and
records this cycle's cluster and recurrence history.

Defects ingested as `addressable:false` (source quality, contested topics, tool limits) are
surfaced separately as "won't patch" — to prevent guideline bloat.

Usage:
    python tools/mine_failures.py               # only after the watermark (or all if none)
    python tools/mine_failures.py --all         # full re-review
    python tools/mine_failures.py --since 2026-06-01
    python tools/mine_failures.py --checkpoint --note "..."   # confirm review complete
