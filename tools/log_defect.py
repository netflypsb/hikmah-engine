"""Append defect/transition records to the `tools/_defect-log.jsonl` corpus.

The ingest entry point for the automatic defect-to-guideline improvement loop (the
automatic channel of the SoT self-evolution workflow). At cycle close, the
Editor-in-Chief loads that cycle's escaped defects in one batch — which classes, and on
what trigger, is specified in `.claude/agents/editor-in-chief.md` — and records the
accept/reject transitions of guideline edits into the same corpus. The
corpus accumulates longitudinal recurrence rates; unlike the review watermarks
(`_feedback-review.json`, `_failure-review.json`) it is committed, so a fresh clone starts
with the recurrence history rather than blind. That makes it public — keep the free-text
fields (mechanism · rationale · note) technical English. `mine_failures.py` reads this
corpus in aggregate.

Why the ingest point is a single batch at the cycle gate rather than every lint run:
self-VERIFY₀ + VERIFY₁ + regression repetition double-counts the same FAIL and inflates
commit noise. One batch → low noise.

Two record kinds (`kind`):
- defect:     {date, layer, target, caught_at, check, cluster, mechanism, severity, addressable,
               grounded_at?, run}
- transition: {date, cluster, surface, change, held_in_delta, held_out_delta, decision,
               rationale, model, note, commit, held_in_sampled, held_out_sampled}
               # model = the measuring apparatus's model generation (MODELS — a join key)
               # note  = prose about the apparatus's composition (which role, how many rotations)

`cluster` is the slugified mechanism-cluster key (kebab-case; transitions may
suffix `@<stage>`) — the join key between defects, transitions, and the
mine_failures grouping. `mechanism` stays as an optional free-text label.
`date` is the day the defect was caught. For a stage that catches a defect as the cycle
produces it, that is also roughly when it was written; for a stage that sweeps standing
state (`audit`, `desk:bundle`, a `blind` residual sweep) it is not, so such a record
orders nothing against a transition date — `mine_failures` skips those stages when
deciding whether a treatment failed, and counts them toward support either way.

caught_at has the form `<stage>:<detail>` (e.g. `lint:source`, `desk:density`) —
the leading segment carries which verification surface caught it. Transition
`rationale` (one-line why) + `model` (the generation that produced the measured
output — MODELS vocabulary) make the accept/reject ledger auditable.

`grounded_at` is optional — the rung at which the authoring role stopped on the GROUND
Ladder (`R0`-`R4`; SoT is `.claude/agents/README.md` § GROUND Ladder). Validated for form
when present: a typo'd rung would silently corrupt the very distribution the field exists
to observe (which rung under-read defects concentrate at).

The two fields are the record's two coordinates in the four-loop model (CLAUDE.md § The
Four Loops): `grounded_at` is the input side (how deep the author read before writing),
`caught_at` the feedback side (the surface that caught it — `lint`·`desk` are the content
ladder's surfaces, spanning the inner and outer loops; `desk:bundle` is the Reground loop;
`blind`·`probe` the Meta loop's own verification, and `audit` its discovery surface — the
periodic exhaustive pass over the standing code and instruction layer, where `blind`·`probe`
instead verify one proposed change).

`operator` is the wiki operator (CLAUDE.md § Human Reviewer Gate), a stopping condition
inside the other loops rather than a cycle of its own, so the mapping above gains no
entry for it. Use it for a defect the operator caught — at the gate or after everything
shipped — and not as a fallback when the catching surface is merely unclear: no
automated surface reports these, so a wrong value here has no correction path.

Usage:
    echo '{"kind":"defect","target":"...","cluster":"...","caught_at":"lint:source"}' \
        | python tools/log_defect.py
    python tools/log_defect.py < records.json   # accepts either a JSON array or JSONL
