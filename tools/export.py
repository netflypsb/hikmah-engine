"""Export wiki to merged files for Claude.ai Project Knowledge.

Produces `wiki-export/` with three categories of files:

  Root meta copies
    overview.md, contradiction.md, index.md — one-to-one copies from wiki/.

  Sub-folder merges
    all-overviews.md, all-contradictions.md, all-timelines.md,
    all-syntheses.md, all-trails.md — each merges every
    regular page in the matching sub-folder (underscore-prefixed files skipped).

  Source locator index (hub-centric RAG)
    all-sources-index.md — a single file listing every source as one line
    (slug + title + date + summary snippet), grouped by primary cluster from
    graph/_clusters.json. Source *bodies* are not exported: the hosted graph
    browser already carries every source as a full-text node (graph/_pages.json,
    reachable via #q=<slug>), and every source is referenced by ≥1 hub's
    frontmatter `sources:` list (0 orphans). So the RAG corpus holds the
    synthesized hubs plus this locator, and Claude.ai deep-links source originals
    into the graph by slug. Two-tier model: RAG = synthesis, graph = evidence.

Run: `python tools/export.py`.
