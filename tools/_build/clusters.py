"""Landscape axis builder — owns every cluster-indexed artefact.

Three concerns, one module per axis (mirrors contradictions.py on the
conflict axis):

  1. run()          — graph/_clusters.json (Leiden topology clustering
                      over entity+concept subgraph; propagates source
                      assignments; stable labels via cluster_labels.json).
  2. run_catalogs() — wiki/sources/_catalog-<cluster>.md + _catalog.md
                      (per-cluster source listings; migrated from index.py
                      in the Phase B pipeline refactor).
  3. run_pages()    — wiki/overviews/<cluster>.md (L2-3) + wiki/overview.md
                      (L2-4) AUTO-block regeneration. EDITOR blocks are
                      preserved; files without AUTO markers are skipped
                      so hand-authored content is never overwritten.

Pipeline ordering (tools/build.py): graph → clusters → contradictions → index.
