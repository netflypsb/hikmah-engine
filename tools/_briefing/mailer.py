"""Gmail SMTP delivery (STARTTLS). Zero external dependencies — only stdlib smtplib / email.

Credentials and recipients come from environment variables:
  GMAIL_USER           sending Gmail address (e.g. sender@example.com)
  GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD   16-char Gmail app password (not the regular password)
  BRIEFING_RECIPIENTS  recipients, comma-separated

To keep addresses and passwords out of the repo, inject them only via GH Secrets (or local env).
