"""Uniform layer-cascade staleness lint — one rule for every content type.

The wiki is a dependency DAG (L1 raw → L2-1 source → L2-2 hub → L2-3 → L2-4).
A page is **stale** when anything it derives from changed after it was last
authored. This rule adds a *uniform upstream-content freshness* signal across
all derived content types (previously only overview/contradiction had partial,
per-type freshness). It is **orthogonal to**, not a replacement for, the
existing checks: set-change (overview AUTO-drift·contradiction claims-drift —
member/claim set added/removed), within-page metadata hygiene (overview/
contradiction freshness), and semantic (anchor invasion) measure different
things a date cascade cannot capture. Those checks stay.

Rule (consumes `graph/_dependencies.json`, built by `tools/_build/dependencies.py`):

    page is STALE  ⇔  upstream_max_date > page.effective_date

`upstream_max_date` is the newest `last_updated` among the page's upstream
(the layer it derives from). A stale page may be referencing superseded
members/sources and should be re-checked by its author.

`effective_date` is the page's authored freshness. For most pages this is the
frontmatter `last_updated` stored in `_dependencies.json`. **For derived
narrative types** (overview·contradiction·synthesis·trail·timeline + the L2-4
root meta files) it is instead the EDITOR-body last-commit date
(`_editor_date.editor_last_commit_date`, git-derived, AUTO-block churn excluded)
whenever that is OLDER than the frontmatter date. Rationale: a partial edit that
touches only AUTO blocks or a non-narrative section (e.g. the 2026-06-13 recency
batch that added a `## Recent Changes` section to every overview) bumps frontmatter
`last_updated` WITHOUT re-grounding the narrative. Keying staleness on that
inflated date masks a body that is months behind its sources — the very gap this
lint exists to catch. Using the EDITOR-body date as the baseline closes it; when
the two diverge the report names both (`body=<git date>` vs `last_updated=<fm>`).

Rollout: **advisory mode** — reports but does not gate the exit code (the
138-stale backlog precludes gating until triaged). Coverage limits: only pages
with neither a frontmatter `last_updated` nor an EDITOR-body git date are out
of scope. L2-4 root meta files (overview.md/contradiction.md) are in scope via
the git EDITOR-body date (`_BODY_DATED_ROOTS`) and drop out only when git is
unavailable.
