"""Synthesis page schema lint — `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md` (L2-3 Q-A axis).

A synthesis is a cross-source analytic answer to a standing question/tension —
it integrates already-ingested material (hubs·sources·themes) into one
navigable document. This module checks the structural contract codified in
`.claude/layers/synthesis.md` and reuses the manifest roster for the
completion-criteria string (mirrors `overview.py` / `source.py`).

Three structural (layers-owned, craft-free) criteria are auto-measured here:
  * struct.schema-sections — `## Summary` + `## Connections` present + ≥1 `## N.` analytic section
  * struct.source-coverage — frontmatter `sources:` largely re-appear as body [[links]]
  * struct.source-exists   — every declared `sources:` slug is a real wiki/sources/ file
  * enc.slug-alias (L1)     — no raw ≥10-char kebab slug exposed without pipe alias
Plus advisory W1 (link density) · F1 (last_updated) · [Placement] (mis-filed
news/briefing detection) · J1 (conflation surface — claim lines joining ≥2
declared sources, so the desk verifies each span-by-span rather than spot-
checking 1–2; lint surfaces WHERE, the join's validity stays desk-judged). Those
four are advisory only and never gate the exit code.

Two checks hard-gate even under ADVISORY_MODE — MarkupLeak (tool-call XML in the
body) and Type (frontmatter `type` not matching the group). Both are silent
corruption: nothing rewrites the page on either, and no other lint group checks the
`type` of a `wiki/syntheses/` page, so this gate is the only one that sees it.

Craft criteria (jrn.lede·con.scr·cit.* etc.) in the manifest roster are
manual (M) — judged by desk VERIFY₂, not auto-measured here (same split as
overview.py: roster drives the completion count, lint measures the A subset).

Migration mode: this lint runs in **advisory mode** until the synthesis seed
calibration batch (plan step 2) brings existing files to compliance and tunes
thresholds against the exemplar. FAIL counts display but exit code stays 0 so
the new group does not break `lint all`. Flip `ADVISORY_MODE = False` after
calibration. Mirrors the `source.py` rollout precedent.
