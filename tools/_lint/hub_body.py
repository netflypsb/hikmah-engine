"""L2-2 hub body density advisory lint — entities / concepts.

Promotes two patterns observed cumulatively across pages in the B1 batch 2 Desk
review into deterministic detection. A concept hub is navigational-anchor in
nature, so when its body bloats to deep-dive-report scale the separation of
responsibilities blurs and the `## Connections` section loses its nav-anchor
function and degenerates into a reference list.

Detected items:
  * Body length advisory — advisory when the body ≥ 12,000 chars after stripping
    frontmatter + HTML comments. Recommends distributing via sub-hub delegation
    (referencing `[[related hub]]`).
  * `## Connections` link count advisory — advisory when the connections section
    has ≥ 50 wikilinks. Recommends category grouping or removing multiple entries
    for a single entity.

`--fix` not supported — which H2 to delegate to a sub-hub and which links to
prune are semantic-judgment territory (handled in the columnist ADAPT cycle).

# The regex and stripping for measuring body density and `## Connections`
# grouping were moved into the encyclopedia-writing skill (evaluate_hub_body).
# This module handles only inbound / central_anchor / issue formatting.

# Thresholds — advisory lines set from B1 batch 1·2 measurements.
# Body 12,000 chars: a deep-dive range 4x the cleanup A bucket (≥3,000 chars)
# average. Connections section 50 links: observed the nav anchor → reference list
# degeneration in the FinancialAI 65-link case. 50 is a conservative hard advisory
# line. The actual threshold is SoT in the manifest (_HUB_PARAMS) — the advisory
# message also interpolates the manifest value directly so the threshold and the
# output cannot desync.

# Centrality recalibration — the body-length advisory targets hubs bloating
# PAST their navigational-anchor role. But two hub classes are legitimately
# content-rich and splitting them fragments coherent units:
#   1. entity hubs — single-subject pages (a company/bank/agency); length
#      reflects the subject's coverage breadth, not bloat.
#   2. top-centrality concept anchors — the most-linked concepts ARE the
#      navigational core, so breadth is expected.
# So the prose advisory is skipped for entity hubs and for any hub whose
# inbound EXTRACTED link count ≥ CENTRALITY_EXEMPT. The signal then focuses
# on lower-centrality concept hubs where sub-hub delegation genuinely helps.
