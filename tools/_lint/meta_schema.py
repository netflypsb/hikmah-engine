"""Meta-doc schema lint — CLAUDE.md + .claude/commands/*.md + .claude/layers/*.md
conventions.

Paired with content_schema.py (wiki/overviews + wiki/contradictions). Where
content_schema verifies L2-3 content files against their documented formats,
this module verifies the meta-docs that document those formats comply with
their own conventions.

Concerns bundled here because all target meta-docs, all are read-only
(no --fix), and all run in <1 second — no benefit from separate CLI surfaces:

  INTEGRITY — CLAUDE.md self-consistency:
    1. Anchor links `[text](#anchor)` resolve to an existing heading.
    2. Backtick-wrapped file paths (wiki/*, tools/*, graph/*, .claude/*,
       wiki-export/*) exist on disk, skipping placeholders and code blocks.
    3. Every `/wiki-<name>` slash command mentioned in CLAUDE.md has a
       matching `.claude/commands/wiki-<name>.md` definition file.

  LANGUAGE — meta-doc section headers must be English (CLAUDE.md +
             .claude/commands/*.md).
    Rule rationale: Korean section headers weaken the "write the body in Korean"
    output rule for Claude.

  FLAT-PATH guard — stale `python tools/lint.py <flat-subcmd>` invocations
                    must migrate to the post-refactor `<group> [<sub>]` form.

  RESERVED FILENAME — wiki/**/*.md basenames must not case-fold to reserved
                      meta-doc names (CLAUDE.md, README.md). On case-insensitive
                      filesystems (Windows NTFS, default macOS) such files
                      shadow the harness's reserved lookup and get injected
                      as project instructions. Discovered 2026-05-01 via
                      wiki/entities/Claude.md case-folding to CLAUDE.md.

  LOG MONOTONICITY — log.md entries must appear oldest-first with
                     date(entry[i+1]) >= date(entry[i]). The `grep ... | tail -10`
                     idiom in the Log Format spec only works under this
                     convention. Claude sessions occasionally misplaced new
                     entries at the top before this guard existed; a one-off
                     sort restored order (2026-04-21) and this check prevents
                     re-drift. Advisory by default — no auto-sort here, since
                     rewriting audit log ordering is a sensitive operation best
                     kept under explicit human/Claude review.

  HOOK BASH-PREFIX — every settings(.local).json hook `command` that runs a
                     `.sh` script must invoke it through a leading `bash`
                     token. Windows shells cannot execute a bare `.sh` path,
                     so a hook registered without the `bash ` prefix silently
                     no-ops and its guard/advisory never fires — an invisible
                     failure mode. See .claude/policies/platform.md "Hook Execution Environment (Windows)".

  HOOK ADVISORY CHANNEL — a non-blocking hook (no `exit 2` path) that writes
                     its message to stderr never reaches Claude: stderr on
                     exit 0 is shown to the user only. Advisories must emit the
                     message as stdout JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.
                     Blocking guards (with an `exit 2` path) are exempt — exit-2
                     stderr IS delivered to Claude. See platform.md "Hook Execution Environment (Windows)".

  HOOK PYTHON UTF-8 — every hook `python3` invocation must force UTF-8 mode
                     (`PYTHONUTF8=1`). On Windows python3 decodes stdin/stdout
                     as cp949, mangling a hook's Korean output into lone
                     surrogates that poison the session JSON (400) — an
                     unrecoverable crash. See platform.md "Hook Execution Environment (Windows)".

  CRAFT-SKILL INTEGRITY — the craft skill chain (`.claude/skills/<skill>/`
                     {criteria.json, checks.py} + `.claude/layers/_manifest.json`
                     + `.claude/layers/*.md`) must stay referentially closed:
                     every craft dot-id (jrn/con/enc/cit) referenced by the
                     manifest (checks · bundle produces · roster) or by a layers
                     guide must be defined in some skill's criteria.json; every
                     bundle `fn` and every judge=A `algorithm` must be a function
                     in that skill's checks.py; each criterion's judge schema
                     must be well-formed (A → comparator + default_threshold,
                     M → pass_condition). A dangling dot-id silently drops a
                     criterion from evaluation.

  STALE GUIDE REF — pre-merge guide filenames `<x>-authoring.md` /
                     `<x>-rubric.md` (now merged into .claude/layers/<type>.md)
                     must not survive in code or .claude docs (log.md is
                     append-only and exempt). A stale reference points readers
                     at a file that no longer exists.

  OBSIDIAN LINK SAFETY — generated drill-down meta (wiki/index.md +
                     wiki/sources/_catalog*.md) link display text must not carry
                     a raw `[`/`]` (Obsidian Live Preview breaks the link even
                     when escaped — use lenticular 【】 via safe_link_text) or end
                     with a `\\` (escapes the closing `]`). Regression guard for
                     the build pipeline's bracket/quote sanitization.

  NESTED WIKILINK — authored narrative (wiki/overview(s), wiki/contradiction(s),
                     hub pages, syntheses, trails) must not nest `[[` inside a
                     wikilink alias. Obsidian closes the outer link at the first
                     `]]`, rendering a truncated alias + stray `]]`. Fix: flatten
                     the inner link to plain text. sources/ and `_`-prefixed
                     generated files are out of scope.

  DEFECT LEDGER — every `tools/_defect-log.jsonl` record must pass
                     `log_defect.validate()`. The validating entrance exists
                     (`log_defect.py`) but write paths can bypass it — Write,
                     Edit, a bash append and a whole-file script rewrite all
                     land in the same file, and the Write|Edit guard never sees
                     the bash form. Validating the artifact instead of sealing
                     every write path catches all of them while still allowing
                     the in-place corrections a ledger legitimately needs. The
                     only other net is pytest, which runs before a commit
                     rather than at the cycle gate.
