"""graph/_clusters.json diagnostic — Leiden cluster health report.

Consumes the output of `_build/clusters.py`. File name mirrors the data
source (graph/_clusters.json) so the lint counterpart is discoverable
alongside the builder.

Reports:
  - [A] Isolated hubs (entities/concepts with no edges → excluded from clustering)
  - [B] Small clusters (size < MIN_SIZE) — likely over-split, candidate for merge
  - [C] removed — it scored the partition against frontmatter `tags`; the letters of
    the surviving codes are kept so existing references still resolve (see run())
  - [D] Unlabeled clusters — no match in graph/cluster_labels.json; human
    review needed to add a stable label
  - [E] Unassigned sources — sources with no outbound edges to any clustered hub
  - [F] Orphan labels — slug in graph/cluster_labels.json without a matching
    community in the current Leiden output (former cluster dissolved or
    anchor_members drifted). Informational — label pruning is domain
    judgment (CLAUDE.md naming rule), not lint-automatable.
  - [G] Fragile bridges — pairs of clusters connected by exactly one edge.
    Flags community-boundary fragility: removing that single [[wikilink]]
    would sever the two domains entirely. Informational — resolution may
    be "reinforce with more cross-references" (if the link reflects real
    relation) or "accept as truly distant domains". Surfaces hidden
    refactor risk before cluster boundaries shift.

Every invocation appends a one-line JSONL record of core health metrics
(node/edge counts, edges-per-node, isolated-hub rate, community count,
largest-community size, fragile-bridge count) to graph/_health-log.jsonl.
Enables trend detection: catch connectivity regressions over ingest
bursts without manual snapshots.

`--fix` mode regenerates `_graph.json` and `_clusters.json` from current
wiki state before the diagnostic runs. This mirrors the SoT-freshness
contract: when the user asks to fix cluster health, they expect the
underlying SoT JSON to reflect the current wiki, not yesterday's build.
The deterministic Python rebuild (Leiden) makes this safe to run
automatically — no human/LLM judgment is involved. Downstream MD
side-effects (catalogs, overview AUTO blocks) are NOT regenerated here
to keep the operation surprise-free; run `python tools/build.py
clusters` for the full landscape-axis cascade.

Exit code 0 if nothing actionable, 1 otherwise. JSON mode for automation.
