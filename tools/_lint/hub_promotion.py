"""L2-2 stub → full hub promotion candidate triage advisory — entities / concepts.

Derived from a PoC (2026-05-24, 43 measured): a high-value stub that should be
grown into a full hub (many citations but a thin body) **cannot be caught without
false negatives by a sources-count threshold alone**.
  * Strong promotion candidates genuinely exist at src5 (IBK기업은행) and
    src6 (RedTeaming) → raising the threshold to ≥10/16 misses them.
  * src17 (CloudMigration) and src8 (한국클라우드CSP) have bodies that already
    completed cross-source integration and are self-sufficient → looking at
    sources alone over-triggers.

The real discriminator is the **intersection of "many citations (inbound) ∩ thin
body (stub)" + inbound cluster spread**, and inbound·cluster are computed
deterministically from the graph. This module handles only that first-pass auto
triage. Promotion is finalized by the desk's lightweight secondary gate (overlap
with an adjacent hub's integration area / possibility of absorption into a parent
concept / skew toward a single subject or event group) — semantic judgment, so
`--fix` is not supported.

Detection conditions (AND):
  * stub — body < STUB_MAX chars after stripping frontmatter + HTML/AUTO
  * sources ≥ SOURCES_MIN (many-citations floor)
  * inbound ≥ INBOUND_HOT  OR  inbound distinct clusters ≥ CLUSTER_SPREAD
    (many citations or cross-cluster integration value)
Grade: strong = both inbound·cluster met / medium = only one.
