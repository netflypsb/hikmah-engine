"""Network helpers with SSRF protection for the fetch_* CLI tools.

`safe_get` and `safe_get_stream` are drop-in replacements for
`requests.get` that validate the target host's resolved IPs against an
RFC 1918 / loopback / link-local / metadata-endpoint blocklist BEFORE
the request is sent — and re-validate on every redirect hop.

Why: the wiki's mobile inbox path pulls untrusted URLs from
`raw/_inbox.md` and feeds them to `requests.get(...)`. Without scheme +
host validation, an attacker could craft a URL that resolves to
`169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata), `127.0.0.1`, or any RFC 1918 host
and reach internal services from the operator's machine. Cross-origin
HTTP redirects to private ranges have the same effect.

Trade-offs intentionally NOT covered:
- DNS rebinding (validate-then-fetch race) — would require socket-level
  IP pinning. The window is small for human-driven inbox ingest, so we
  accept the residual risk.
- IPv6-mapped IPv4 (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`) — `ipaddress.ip_address` reports
  these as IPv6 and `is_private`/`is_loopback` flags don't catch them by
  default. `_is_blocked_ip` explicitly extracts the v4 mapping when
  present.
- Outbound proxy honoring — environment proxies still apply since we use
  a fresh `requests.Session()`. Operators routing through corporate
  proxies should set NO_PROXY or trust the proxy's allowlist.
