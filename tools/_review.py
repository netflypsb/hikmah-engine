"""Shared review-cycle watermark — mine_feedback (human channel) and mine_failures (automated channel).

Both self-evolution input tools use the same watermark skeleton: `{last_review, history[]}`.
Only file I/O and advancing last_review are factored out here; the per-channel fields of
each history entry (correction_counts vs. cluster_counts, recurrence computation) are built
by each tool — the identifying part is shared, the divergent part stays with the caller.
